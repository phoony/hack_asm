# hack_asm

A Nand2Tetris Hack Assembly Language Assembler written in Rust

## About

For this project, I set out to implement a simple assembler for the Nand2Tetris assembly language. I also practice using Cargo and crates.io, because this is my very first published crate.

## Usage

```console
hack_asm <INPUT_FILE>
```

For a given input.asm this will generate an input.hack file.
